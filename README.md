### Project Overview  

The script dynamically injects a product carousel into the **eBebek** homepage, displaying recommended products fetched from an external API. It ensures that:  
- The carousel appears only on the homepage.  
- Users can scroll through the products with navigation buttons.  
- Clicking a product opens its page in a new tab.  
- Discounted products display both the original and discounted prices along with the discount percentage.  
- Users can mark products as favorites, and their preferences are saved in **Local Storage** for persistence.  
- The design is fully responsive across different screen sizes.  

### Key Features  

- **Dynamic HTML & CSS Generation:** The carousel structure is created purely with JavaScript.  
- **API Integration:** Products are retrieved via a GET request, with fallback storage in Local Storage to optimize performance.  
- **Local Storage for Favorites:** Favorited items persist even after a page refresh.  
- **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly for various devices.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Products are only fetched when necessary, reducing redundant API calls.  

### My Learning & Development  

During this project, I improved my skills in:  
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Creating and managing elements dynamically.  
- **Local Storage Handling:** Storing and retrieving data efficiently.  
- **API Fetching & Caching:** Optimizing data retrieval for better performance.  
- **Responsive Web Development:** Ensuring the layout adapts to different screen sizes.  
- **Event Handling in JavaScript:** Managing user interactions effectively.  

This project was a valuable experience in implementing a real-world feature using JavaScript while following strict requirements.
